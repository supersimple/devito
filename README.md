# Devito
![](https://github.com/supersimple/devito/blob/main/devito-sm.png?raw=true)

 An Elixir and CubDB based url shortener.

## Interface
Devito is designed to be used with the [Devito CLI](https://github.com/supersimple/devito_cli/). Although you can also interface it using HTTP.

## Configuration
Authorization is handled via an API token. You must pass `auth_token=<VALUE>` with each request, and that token will be matched against the ENV VAR `AUTH_TOKEN`. The values cannot be set to `nil`.

Configure the application's short_code_chars to a list of values you want the short_code to be generated from.

`config :devito,
  short_code_chars: []`

## Endpoints
| Method | Path | Description | Required Params | Optional Params |
|--------|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|

| POST | /api/link | Create a new link | auth_token=TOKEN; short_code=SHORTCODE; auth_token=TOKEN |
| GET | /api/SHORTCODE | Shows info about a link | - | - |
| POST | /api/import | imports JSON links | body=JSON | - |
